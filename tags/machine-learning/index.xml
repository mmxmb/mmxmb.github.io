      <description>This article was originally pusblished on Medium.com together with Towards Data Science.
 Introduction  &amp;ldquo;In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives.</description>

      <description>Introduction On one of my favorite wargame websites has a series of challanges on breaking CAPTCHA. It starts with a straightforward challange:
 Please enter the CAPTCHA backwards Time remaining: 10.00 seconds
 Since no distortions are introduced to the text and there are ~100 distinct shapes, there are plenty of ways to read the text off the image without resorting to machine learning.
The next one is even easier - only 12 distinct shapes:</description>
