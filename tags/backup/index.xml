      <description>Is there a simple way to backup non-rooted Android phone to a Borg repo? Since the phone is non-rooted, this greatly limits the kind of files that can be accessed and backed up. For instance, if you want to backup a Google Authenticator database, root is needed to access/data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases (see this Android Stack Exchange question). But if you want to only backup data from device user storage, then root is not needed.</description>

      <description>Does the dandelion drop all its seeds at the base of its stalk? Does the cuckoo lay its eggs in one nest? So long as your backups are in one place, you are vulnerable to the fortunes of the world.
